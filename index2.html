    <p> I am a second year PhD Student with the School of Computing and Information Sciences. Currently, my research is focused on automated spectrum enforcement. Additionally, I have recently joined the Graduate and Professional Student Government (GPSG) Event Planning Committee where I assist in planning and executing events for the graduate population at the University of Pittsburgh. Moreover, I am also dedicated to fostering my skills as a future educator, therefore I am also taking courses with Pitt CIRTL to obtain tools to implement active learning techniques within the classroom. My overall mission is to be awesome and do great things!

       <h2>Blog I: Discovering Communities and Anomalies in Attributed Graphs: Interactive Visual Exploration and Summarization </h2>
          <h4>Friday, 29 September 2017</h4>
          <p>Dr. Leman Akoglu</p>
          <p align="justify">I arrived on Friday to very packed talk by Dr. Akoglu full of eager minds and obstructed views to hear her discussion on anomalies in attributed graphs. From where I was sitting (in what can be considered the nosebleed seats), she was just beginning her explanation of calculating optimization of normality.
              Unfortunately for me, there was little context to her words as I could not see the screen, but the thought of optimizing normality interested me. The discussion then flowed in to the graphs and data she used and how randomizing nodes within a given group could be utilized in order to identify attributes and see the anomalies within social networks like FaceBook. 
              The research she presented is along the line of her dissertation which focuses on mining and modeling real world networks.</p>
      
        <h2>Blog II: Validating Computer Security Methods: Meta-Methodology for an Adversarial Science</h2>
          <h4>Friday,06 October 2017</h4>
          <p>Dr. Antonio Roque</p>
          <p align="justify">This talk was very insightful on a theoretical and philiosophical level. Many of the ideologies Dr. Roque provided were dervived from various disciplines and lessons of others (e.g. social scieneces, philosophy, and military command and control. The only qualm that I had during his lecture was him likening cybersecurity to military warfare. As a veteran, and having 11 years experience and knowledge regarding rules of engagement and laws of armed conflict, what I always have an issue with is that Cybersecurity is not analogous to war. In wars there is - for the most part- a clearly defined enemy or adversarial element. With cybersecurity however, the adversary is typically unknown. Additionally, there are defined rules to warfare and cybersecurity is still trying to work out the semantic kinks of what it means to "do harm". 
             Aside from my personal thoughts on the differences between cybersecurity and war, I thought the talk was filled with interesting insights that many students here can benefit from. The way Dr. Roque introduced his methodologies and meta-methodologies and what it means to verify why a process is a process and even walking through common problems, questions, and considerations (despite being hidden between various tangents), it was beneficial to not only work with cybersecurity, but the many topics we discuss here within the School of Computing and Information Sciences. </p>
      
        <h2>Blog III: Blockchain Privacy: Challenges, Solutions, and Unresolved Issues</h2>

          <p align="justify">This talk was born out of ideologies and concepts fostered by Herb Simon (whom we have discussed many times throughout this semester). In this talk, Dr. Llach discusses the dichotomy between "automation and augmentation" in design.</p>
      
       
        <h2>Blog V: Teaching Workshop Tuesday</h2>
          <h4>17 October 2017 2017</h4>

          <p align="justify">During this dissertation defense, Julio discussed his research on Open Learner Models and social components.
