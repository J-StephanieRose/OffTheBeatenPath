 <h4>More About This Project</h4>
<justify>
<div>
<button class="accordion">Overview</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The United States is experiencing spectrum scarcity, or so most research and initiatives would have the community believe. This argument has been the premise for several initiatives on how to best utilize and allocate radio spectrum. However, with the advent of the Internet of Things and 5G services, it has become important to take a look at the governing policy and regulatory efforts in order to develop measures on how to deal with enforcement â€“ specifically automated enforcement- for spectrum interference. My research for this project investigates the enforcement of commercial spectrum and how the Federal Communication's Enforcement Bureau adjudicates interference issues within radio frequency bands. My hypothesis is that radio spectrum interference is an important and serious issue that needs to be alleviated before emerging technologies enter the current spectrum environment. Moreover, it is possible that there is an enforcement disparity in which "would be offenders" are not necessarily dissuaded from interfering with radio spectrum. Through my research, I hope to gain a better understanding of the enforcement measures and process in order to develop an automated enforcement structure that would best encapsulate policy/ regulator needs and requirements for fair and consistent enforcement of radio spectrum.</p>
  </div>


<button class="accordion">Research Questions</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>As this is the first phase of this research project, the main questions I wanted to answer were: 
<p><center>1. How often does radio spectrum interference take place?</center></p>
<p><center>2. Who are the main offenders/violators?</center></p> 
<p><center>3. What kind of interference and/or violations related to radio frequency occur?</center></p>
Although the FCC currently has a map dedicated to enforcement of pirate radio, that is only one type of interference/violation. As radio spectrum moves to become an even more shared environment between commercial and federal users, I hope to find out what (if any) other interference/violations happen within these frequencies in order to better determine how to automate spectrum enforcement.</p>
  </div>

<button class="accordion">Methodology</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Since the FCC Enforcement Bureaus database in primarily html files (will all of the document content coded under <pre>), I manually investigated 650 various cases of radio spectrum explicit interference. Through the process of coding each case manually, I have realized there are implicit and explicit cases of spectrum interference. It appears that this may be a lack of standard (or lack of adhered standard) across the different enforcement bureaus (which cover regions 1, 2, 3, and the FCC main branch in D.C.). Each manually coded case for enforcement (whether radio interference explicit/implicit or not) was coded into a spreadsheet. Attributes that I captured included Name of violator, case number (linked to the original html document on the FCC transition.fcc.gov website), date of violation, location, frequency (what frequency they interfered with and/or transmitted on illegally), enforcement type (e.g. warning, notice of violation, penalty (with fine if appropriate), publication (e.g. NOV, FOUO, Consent Decree, Forfeiture, etc.), entity type (e.g. business, individual, duo, religious establishment, or educational institution), enforcement bureau dept region, enforcement bureau department location, and whether or not the violator was a license holder at the time of their offense (which was annotated in their case file).  
After collecting the preliminary data (2017 enforcement cases), I reviewed various digital tools in order to find one that would enable me to not only geographically show where radio interference and enforcement are taking place, but also allow me to provide context to each case. Unfortunately, I had to eliminate tools such as ArcGIS, ColorBrewer, and Scribble Maps due to the time constraints, user error, and not really being able to fully provide the details I felt were important to analyze and contextualize the dynamics between interference and enforcement. Eventually, I ended up with a mock up version which was created using Google Maps. By utilizing Google Maps to begin to actualize what data I want to investigate further, I was able to upload and create several layers for different years of enforcement. Since each year of enforcement action varies by color, it is much easier to assess possible trends or "hot spots" for interference.  
Furthermore, I completed a brief analysis on the data I have collected thus far. Although these are only initial results, they appear to be showing trends which may lead to additional questions in the second phase and provide a better understanding of the violators/interference cases, but also the manner in which the FCC handles them.</p>
  </div>

<button class="accordion">Results</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p><i>Preliminary Results</i></p>
<p>Based on the 2017 data extracted and visualized using Google Fusion Tables, spectrum interference does not appear to be the epidemic one might envision. Main offenders appear to be individuals operating unlicensed operations from residential areas. Additionally, it seems that majority of the offenders are located on the east and west coasts. Majority of the offenses are unlicensed operation notices. Based on the data, violations from businesses and/or major service providers were limited or non-existent.</p> 
 
<p><i>Initial Results â€“ Phase I</i></p>  
<p>Upon further research (2014-2016), one of the most prominent factors while traversing the FCC Enforcement Bureau's database is that there are many types of violations (some that directly hinder/ interfere with other licensee's), while other infractions are violations of the licensees' agreement (e.g. breach of contract). Overall there are a myriad of violators for pirate radio, exceeding power limits, and expired licenses (sometimes for years). All of these actions contribute to the towards radio frequency interference.</p>

<button class="accordion">Discussion</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Although my research will not include the federal spectrum element (due to lack of resources, availability/ accessibility of information, and time), finding out what interference/violations are prevalent within commercial spectrum will be a promising start to developing requirements of an automated system and infrastructure.  
Additionally, since the FCC is no longer maintaining their spectrum database, my research will aid in realizing the typical "hot spots" for interference (and recurring types of interference). By completing this project, other researchers may be able to gain a better idea of who the repeat offenders are, what types of violations/ interference these violators are prone to within shared spectrum spaces, which states are most likely to have/receive interference, etc.</p>
  </div>

<button class="accordion">Future Research</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The benefits of this research are that it is current and provides a guide (and hopefully if developed further, a roadmap) of how we can begin to automate spectrum enforcement. The next steps of this project will be to finish coding 1999-2013 of the FCC Enforcement Bureau's database, utilize a more permanent GIS tool with the functionality to show where spectrum is occurring while also allowing various content and attributes specific to each case, analyze the data in its entirety (1999-2017), and begin establishing system requirements in order to develop automated spectrum enforcement for policy as a service (PaaS).</p>

<button class="accordion">LIS 3600 - What This Course Demonstrated to Me</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>I am still the headstrong individual my parents wished I would eventually grow up and not be. Originally when I selected this topic/direction for this course, I thought my captaset would be a fair amount of work, prep, etc. However, I have come to terms that this research project is highly ambitious and I may have "bitten off more than I can chew". Yet, if there is one thing this course has demonstrated to me, it's that grappling with your data, your tools, and questioning yourself at every turn is essentially the life blood of what most digital humanists - not the crazy ones that did the music research - go through. If the answers and the tools were easy or a "quick fix" would what we are researching really be that important or have an impact? I look forward to working on phase two of my research and seeing what happens next.</p>
